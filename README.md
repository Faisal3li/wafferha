## Thought Process
At first, We drew the structure of our models, also showing an adaptive association with each other. We assembled well order links to our models to provide the user with a trouble-free experience. Secondly, We thought of ways of how the website would work, assigning suiteable names to elements, and then how to connect each part to it's necessary other. Finally We would then practice ways to make our code neater and more understandable.

## What's next?
We would really love to use Stripe or Paypal APIs to diffrentiate our premium users more deceptively.
