## Thought Process
At first, I drew the structure of my models, also showing an adaptive association with each other. I assembled well order links to my models to provide the user with a trouble-free experience. Secondly, I thought of ways of how the website would work, assigning suiteable names to elements, and then how to connect each part to it's necessary other. Finally I would then practice ways to make my code neater and more understandable.

## Unsolved Problems
I would really love to finish my website with a few more quirks like: Add types to posts, add comments and likes, meet-ups near your loacl gym where a session might happen with a trainer, date of posts, friend request, private messaging, and use Heroku also cloudinary.
